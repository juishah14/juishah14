### Hey there!

- 👋 I’m Jui, a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
- 🚀 I recently worked as a Data Engineer at a medical start-up called [Deep Breathe](https://www.deepbreathe.ai/), helping to build their data infrastructure.
- 🔭 I’m passionate about using Data and Software Engineering as a means to implement creative solutions, create positive change, and bring people together. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Cloud technologies and implementing backends with Go.
- ❤️ In my free time, I love to browse Pinterest, make iced coffees, and weightlift!
